# Frienderv2

A rework of Friender, with full MUI component use, keeping the spirit of the original friender while applying experience gained since the first version.

Initially, this will have the code from the original Friender app in it. The plan is to readdress the code by refactoring both front end and back end, and convert it into Typescript. Then resolving previous issues/bugs, as well as re-styling. Finally, additional functionality will be included.
