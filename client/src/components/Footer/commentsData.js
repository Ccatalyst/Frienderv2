Without the app we may have never met and embarked on this wild, wonderful journey. Thank you for bringing us and so many other friends together around the world. I will forever be grateful."`,

I was hanging out with a lot of guys, and I was kind of over that whole social scene. So when I heard about this feature I thought, Iâ€™ll try this. What do I have to lose?  I have made so many meaningful connections!  Thank you Friender!"`,
